netbox-kea-dhcp
===============

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/netbox-kea-dhcp)](https://pypi.org/project/netbox-kea-dhcp/)

Enable use of [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) as a subnet
configuration source for [ISC Kea DHCP server](https://www.isc.org/kea/).

`netbox-kea-dhcp` is a one-way sync daemon that exports NetBox prefixes, IP
ranges and IP addresses to respectively DHCP subnets, pools
and host reservations. It listens for NetBox webhook events, and each time a
change occured, it queries NetBox for the full changed data and update Kea
throught its API.

The program has two modes of operation:

- Full sync at program startup: overwrite current DHCP subnets with new ones
  exported from NetBox.
- Continuous event-driven sync: listen for NetBox webhook events and update
  DHCP configuration accordingly.

Key features
------------

- Automatic sync from Netbox to Kea DHCP with virtualy no delay.
- Update Kea configuration throught its control agent API: no direct
  configuration file overwrites, let’s the control agent manage the runtime
  and permanent configuration.
- Only use open source Kea API commands (no ISC paid subscription required).
- Submit new exported configuration to Kea check before applying it to runtime
  configuration.
- Query NetBox only for the objects concerned by the event (incremental
  sync).
- Get all NetBox data throught the well maintained
  [`pynetbox`](https://github.com/netbox-community/pynetbox) library: unique
  interface, loose dependency with NetBox internals (only with its API),
  reduced code to maintain.
- Customizable NetBox query filters.
- Customizable mapping between Netbox object attributes and DHCP settings.

Requirements
------------

Python: >= 3.8 (tested on 3.10 but may works down to 3.8).

Netbox: validated on API version 3.4.

ISC Kea DHCP: validated on version 2.2.0.

Install
-------

### With pip

`netbox-kea-dhcp` is available on
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/netbox-kea-dhcp/) and can be installed
with `pip install netbox-kea-dhcp`.

### With pipx

A convenient way is to use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install the
application in an isolated environnement.

Install `pipx` (below is for Linux, see
[pipx homepage](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for other systems):

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Install `netbox-kea-dhcp` from PyPi in a isolated environnement:

```sh
pipx install netbox-kea-dhcp
```

Run:

```
netbox-kea-dhcp --help
```

Quick start
-----------

Sync at startup then listen for netbox events:
```sh
netbox-kea-dhcp --netbox-url http://netbox-host \
    --netbox-token 0123456789ABCDEF \
    --kea-url http://kea-api-host --sync-now --listen -v
```

The default mapping between netbox and Kea is:

- prefixes are exported to subnets.
- IP ranges are exported to pools. Custom status value `dhcp` may have to be
  created in netbox configuration file ([netbox-community/netbox#8054](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/8054)):
  ```python
  FIELD_CHOICES = {
    'ipam.IPRange.status+': (
        ('dhcp', 'DHCP', 'red'),
    )
  }
  ```
   
- IP Addresses are exported to reservations. Hardware address is mapped with IP
  address custom field `dhcp_reservation_hw_address` if it exists and is non
  null, otherwise it is mapped with the MAC address of the assigned object.

At least one Netbox webhook needs to be configured for event listening. It has
to notify all actions on DHCP-relevant objects:

- Content types:
  * `IPAM`: `Prefix`, `IP Range`, `IP addresse`.
  * `DCIM`: `Interface`, `Device`.
  * `Virtualization`: `Interface`, `Virtual Machine`.
- Events: `Creations`, `Updates`, `Deletions`.
- HTTP Request:
  * URL: `http://{netbox-connector-host}:{port}/event/{free-text}/`
  * HTTP Method: `POST`.

The field `free-text` is necessary to define several webhooks with same events.
The connector only uses it in logs.

More help with `netbox-kea-dhcp --help` and in the configuration file example
under `examples/` (or under
`~/.local/pipx/venvs/netbox-kea-dhcp/lib/python3.10/site-packages/examples/` if
app was installed with pipx).

Recommended Netbox webhooks
---------------------------

Sysadmins should set several webhooks with conditions and restricted body
template, in order to filter events and avoid unecessary network and CPU load.

Below is a recommended webhook set-up. It assumes that DHCP hardware addresses
are apped with netbox interface MAC addresses. If interfaces are not used
(i.e. hardware addresses are only mapped with a custom field defined in netbox
IP addresses), webhooks on (vm) interfaces, (virtual) devices are not needed.

Common to all webhooks:

- HTTP Request:
  * URL: `http://{netbox-connector-host}:{port}/event/{optional-free-text}/`
  * HTTP Method: `POST`.
- Body template:

    ```json
    { "event": "{{ event }}",
      "model": "{{ model }}",
      "data": { "id": {{ data["id"] }} }
    }
    ```

Webhook 1:

- Content types: `IPAM > Prefix`, `IPAM > IP Range`, `IPAM > IP Address`,
  `DCIM > Device`, `DCIM > Interface`, `Virtualization > Virtual Machine`,
  `Virtualization > Interface`.
- Events: `Updates`
- Conditions: none

Webhook 2:

- Content types: `IPAM > IP Address`
- Events: `Creations`, `Deletions`
- Conditions:

    ```json
    { "and": [ { "attr": "status.value", "value": "dhcp" } ] }
    ```

Webhook 3:

- Content types: `IPAM > IP Range`
- Events: `Creations`, `Deletions`
- Conditions (note: you may have to customize status values to add `dhcp`):

    ```json
    { "and": [ { "attr": "status.value", "value": "dhcp"} ] }
    ```

Webhook 4:

- Content types: `IPAM > Prefix`
- Events: `Creations`, `Deletions`
- Conditions: none, or a custom field

    ```json
    { "and": [ { "attr": "custom_fields.dhcp_enabled", "value": true } ] }
    ```

It’s also recommended to set a TLS-enabled reverse proxy in front of
`netbox-kea-dhcp`.

Limitations
-----------

- When a change occured, the whole DHCP configuration is gotten from Kea,
  modified, and sent back. It may put some stress on the DHCP server in case of
  frequent changes. This is a limitation of Kea open source commands. A better
  update granularity would require an ISC paid subscription.
- When Kea URI is of the form `file:///path/to/kea-config`, config is written
  to the file in an unsafe manner: if the write fails, the file will be
  inconsistent. This is because the file feature is intended for tests.
